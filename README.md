fs-sort is a bulk directory manager, which spares you the annoying job of organising your file system.

It is a autonomous, background program that automatically moves around your newly created files 
and folders into a specific structure that you can define.
fs-sort is fully configurable and runs without ever you noticing.

## Highlights

* üì¶ **Portable** - Easy to install and shareable to your other machines only through the config file;
* ‚ö°Ô∏è **Blazingly Fast** - fs-sort is developed in Rust, giving it swiftness superpowers;
* üõ†Ô∏è **Customizeable** - you can define every bit of your filesystem automation in one single config file;
